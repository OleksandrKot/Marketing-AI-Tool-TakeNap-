  image_description: `A warm, inviting image showing a diverse couple in their late twenties having coffee at a modern caf√©. The woman has curly brown hair and is wearing a soft pink sweater, while the man has short dark hair and a casual blue button-down shirt. They're both smiling genuinely and leaning slightly toward each other across a small round table with two coffee cups.

The lighting is natural and golden, coming through large windows in the background. The caf√© has a cozy, modern aesthetic with exposed brick walls and hanging plants. In the bottom right corner, there's a subtle Lovescape app logo overlay.

The overall mood is authentic, romantic, and aspirational - showing the kind of meaningful connection that the app promises to deliver. The couple appears relaxed and genuinely happy, not posed or artificial.`,
